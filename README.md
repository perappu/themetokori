In my humble, completely not biased opinion, most tumblr themes suck. So I try to make some sort of less sucky ones for myself and others sometimes. Here are any of the ones I've decided to make available for public use.

All of these themes are licensed under the GPLv3, as stated below. This means all of them are open source and you're free to edit them as heavily or as lightly as you wish. However, you need to also license your version under the GPLv3, and you can't prevent people from viewing your blog's source code or get mad if they use a copy of the theme with any changes that you've made.
